**DHG** *(DeepHypergraph)* is a deep learning library built upon [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) for learning with both Graph Neural Networks and Hypergraph Neural Networks. It is a general framework that supports both low-order and high-order message passing like **from vertex to vertex**, **from vertex in one domain to vertex in another domain**, **from vertex to hyperedge**, **from hyperedge to vertex**, **from vertex set to vertex set**.

It supports a wide variety of structures like low-order structures (graph, directed graph, bipartite graph, etc.), high-order structures (hypergraph, etc.). Various spectral-based operations (like Laplacian-based smoothing) and spatial-based operations (like message psssing from domain to domain) are integrated inside different structures. It provides multiple common metrics for performance evaluation on different tasks. Many state-of-the-art models are implemented and can be easily used for research. We also provide various visualization tools for both low-order structures and high-order structures.

In addition, DHG's [dhg.experiments](https://deephypergraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/experiments.html) module (that implements **Auto-ML** upon [Optuna](https://optuna.org)) can help you automatically tune the hyper-parameters of your models in training and easily outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Highlights

- **Support High-Order Message Passing on Structure**:
DHG supports pair-wise message passing on the graph structure and beyond-pair-wise message passing on the hypergraph structure.

- **Shared Ecosystem with Pytorch Framework**:
DHG is built upon Pytorch, and any Pytorch-based models can be integrated into DHG. If you are familiar with Pytorch, you can easily use DHG.

- **Powerful API for Designing GNNs and HGNNs**:
DHG provides various Laplacian matrices and message passing functions to help build your spectral/spatial-based models, respectively.

- **Visualization of Graphs and Hypergraphs**
DHG provides a powerful visualization tool for graph and hypergraph. You can easily visualize the structure of your graph and hypergraph.

- **Bridge the Gap between Graphs and Hypergraphs**:
DHG provides functions to build hypergraph from graph and build graph from hypergraph. Maybe promoting the graph to hypergraph can exploit those potential high-order connections and improve the performance of your model.

- **Attach Spectral/Spatial-Based Operations to Structure**:
In DHG, those Laplacian matrices and message passing functions are attached to the graph/hypergraph structure. As soon as you build a structure with DHG, those functions will be ready to be used in the process of building your model.

- **Comprehensive, Flexible, and Convenience**:
DHG provides random graph/hypergraph generators, various state-of-the-art graph/hypergraph convolutional layers and models, various public graph/hypergraph datasets, and various evaluation metrics.

- **Support Tuning Structure and Model with Auto-ML**:
The Optuna library endows DHG with the Auto-ML ability. DHG supports automatically searching the optimal configurations for the construction of graph/hypergraph structure and the optimal hyper-parameters for your model and training.

## Installation


Current, the stable version of **DHG** is 0.9.4. You can install it with ``pip`` as follows:

```python
pip install dhg
```

You can also try the nightly version (0.9.5) of **DHG** library with ``pip`` as follows:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/iMoonLab/DeepHypergraph.git
```

Nightly version is the development version of **DHG**. It may include the lastest SOTA methods and datasets, but it can also be unstable and not fully tested.
If you find any bugs, please report it to us in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/iMoonLab/DeepHypergraph/issues).

### Dependencies

**DHG** requires the following dependencies:

- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.12.1, < 2.0
- scipy >= 1.8
- matplotlib >= 3.7.0
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- optuna
- requests

For visualization features, matplotlib 3.7.0 or higher is required to properly render 3D plots.

## Quick Start

### Visualization

You can draw the graph, hypergraph, directed graph, and bipartite graph with DHG's visualization tool. More details see the [Tutorial](https://deephypergraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/vis_structure.html)


![Visualization of graph and hypergraph](https://deephypergraph.com/readme_graph_hypergraph.png)

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import dhg
# draw a graph
g = dhg.random.graph_Gnm(10, 12)
g.draw()
# draw a hypergraph
hg = dhg.random.hypergraph_Gnm(10, 8)
hg.draw()
# show figures
plt.show()
```

![Visualization of directed graph and bipartite graph](https://deephypergraph.com/readme_digraph_bigraph.png)

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import dhg
# draw a directed graph
g = dhg.random.digraph_Gnm(12, 18)
g.draw()
# draw a bipartite graph
g = dhg.random.bigraph_Gnm(30, 40, 20)
g.draw()
# show figures
plt.show()
```

### Learning on Low-Order Structures

On graph structures, you can smooth a given vertex features with GCN's Laplacian matrix by:

```python
import torch
import dhg
g = dhg.random.graph_Gnm(5, 8)
X = torch.rand(5, 2)
X_ = g.smoothing_with_GCN(X)
```

On graph structures, you can pass messages from vertex to vertex with `mean` aggregation by:

```python
import torch
import dhg
g = dhg.random.graph_Gnm(5, 8)
X = torch.rand(5, 2)
X_ = g.v2v(X, aggr="mean")
```

On directed graph structures, you can pass messages from vertex to vertex with `mean` aggregation by:

```python
import torch
import dhg
g = dhg.random.digraph_Gnm(5, 8)
X = torch.rand(5, 2)
X_ = g.v2v(X, aggr="mean")
```

On bipartite graph structures, you can smoothing vertex features with GCN's Laplacian matrix by:

```python
import torch
import dhg
g = dhg.random.bigraph_Gnm(3, 5, 8)
X_u, X_v = torch.rand(3, 2), torch.rand(5, 2)
X = torch.cat([X_u, X_v], dim=0)
X_ = g.smoothing_with_GCN(X, aggr="mean")
```

On bipartite graph structures, you can pass messages from vertex in `U` set to vertex in `V` set by `mean` aggregation by:

```python
import torch
import dhg
g = dhg.random.bigraph_Gnm(3, 5, 8)
X_u, X_v = torch.rand(3, 2), torch.rand(5, 2)
X_u_ = g.v2u(X_v, aggr="mean")
X_v_ = g.u2v(X_u, aggr="mean")
```

### Learning on High-Order Structures

On hypergraph structures, you can smooth a given vertex features with HGNN's Laplacian matrix by:

```python
import torch
import dhg
hg = dhg.random.hypergraph_Gnm(5, 4)
X = torch.rand(5, 2)
X_ = hg.smoothing_with_HGNN(X)
```

On hypergraph structures, you can pass messages from vertex to hyperedge with `mean` aggregation by:

```python
import torch
import dhg
hg = dhg.random.hypergraph_Gnm(5, 4)
X = torch.rand(5, 2)
Y_ = hg.v2e(X, aggr="mean")
```
Then, you can pass messages from hyperedge to vertex with `mean` aggregation by:

```python
X_ = hg.e2v(Y_, aggr="mean")
```
Or, you can pass messages from vertex set to vertex set with `mean` aggregation by:

```python
X_ = hg.v2v(X, aggr="mean")
```
